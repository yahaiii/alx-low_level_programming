# ALX Low Level Programming

This repository contains projects and exercises completed as part of the ALX Low Level Programming curriculum. The goal of the curriculum is to learn and understand the low-level programming concepts of the C programming language, which is used to build system software such as operating systems, device drivers, and firmware.

## Projects

The repository contains the following projects:

1. **0x00-hello_world** - Introduction to C programming language and basic programming concepts such as compiling, linking, and writing simple programs.
2. **0x01-variables_if_else_while** - Learning about variables, conditional statements, and loops in C programming.
3. **0x02-functions_nested_loops** - Introduction to functions and nested loops in C programming.
4. **0x03-debugging** - Understanding the process of debugging code in C programming language.
5. **0x04-more_functions_nested_loops** - Reinforcing understanding of functions and nested loops in C programming.
6. **0x05-pointers_arrays_strings** - Learning about pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming.
7. **0x06-pointers_arrays_strings** - Building on the previous project to learn more about pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming.
8. **0x07-pointers_arrays_strings** - Final project in the pointers, arrays, and strings sequence to further develop understanding of these concepts.
9. **0x08-recursion** - Learning about recursive functions and how to implement them in C programming.
